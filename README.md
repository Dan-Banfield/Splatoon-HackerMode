# Splatoon HackerMode
An external Splatoon hack that utilises TCPGecko on the Wii U.

## Installation
To use Splatoon HackerMode, you must first have a [Homebrewed Wii U](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/) with [TCPGecko](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko) installed.

1) Once you have TCPGecko running, and your Wii U is turned on in a Homebrewed state, you can then enter the IP address of your Wii U into Splatoon HackerMode and click 'Connect'. 
2) You should now be able to enable the hacks and send codes to your console!
